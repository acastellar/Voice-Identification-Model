Checkpoints are generated by VoiceReg.py and are the best model of a training session. 
OLD_voice_recognition_best_model.hdf5 is from an older version of tensorflow and this script, but is functional. 
There are no checkpoints here from the current script due to 100MB filesize upload contraints of github, so you will need to run the script to generate the model.
